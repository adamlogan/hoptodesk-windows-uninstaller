# HopToDesk Uninstaller

**TLDR** This is a Windows bat script to uninstall HopToDesk.

**Why?**
I couldn't uninstall the app using ordinary methods (control panel, powershell, uniget etc) as user nor with elevated admin priveleges. I stumbled across this script in a cache directory, this apprently was used for updating HopToDesk, but it worked for me and I decided to share it here. I have not changed the file at all.

**Tested Platform**
I am on Windows 11 Pro ARM edition, Windows OS Update version at the time of testing was 2025H2.
